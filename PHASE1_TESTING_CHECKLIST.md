## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Issue #1: Ref Usage After Unmount (FOUND IN TESTING)
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Locations:**
- `mapbox_map_screen_simple.dart:2530` (in `_addMarkers`)
- `mapbox_map_screen_simple.dart:1961` (in delayed GPS centering)

**Reproduction:**
1. Launch app (starts on 3D map)
2. App loads initial location
3. Errors appear in console about using ref after unmount

**Error Message:**
```
Bad state: Using "ref" when a widget is about to or has been unmounted is unsafe.
Ref relies on BuildContext, and BuildContext is unsafe to use when the widget is deactivated.
```

**Fix Required:**
- Add mounted checks before ref.read() calls
- Save provider state in fields before async operations
- Use ref.onDispose() for cleanup

**Status:** ‚ùå NEEDS FIX
